## Main Strategies

### Strategy 1: Color Focus + Bonus (RECOMMENDED)

**Concept**: Collect 15+ cards of one color to maximize color bonus (+3 points)

**Card Distribution**:
- Blue: 20 cards (Fish 10, Sailboat 6, Penguin 4)
- Red: 20 cards (Crab 10, Shark 6, Seagull 4)
- Yellow: 14 cards (Starfish 8, Swimmer 6)
- Purple: 12 cards (Shell 8, Octopus 4)

**Optimal Execution**:
1. **Identify dominant color** in opening hand (4+ cards)
2. **Prioritize that color** when drawing from discard piles
3. **Pair same-color cards** for effects while maintaining count
4. **Target score**: 15-18 cards of one color = 45-50 points + bonus

**Example Winning Hand**:
```
Blue Focus:
- 8 Fish = 8 points (×2 with Seagull = 16 if you have one)
- 3 Sailboat = 15 points
- 2 Penguin = 8 points
- 4 other cards = ~8 points
Total: ~47 points + 3 color bonus = 50 points ✓
```

**Pros**:
- High consistency (20 cards of blue/red available)
- Natural synergy with multiplier cards
- +3 bonus is significant

**Cons**:
- Telegraphs strategy to opponents
- Vulnerable to color disruption
- Requires good opening hand

**Counter-Play**:
- Opponents steal your color cards
- Opponents declare Stop before you collect enough

---

### Strategy 2: Seagull Multiplier (STRONG)

**Concept**: Collect Fish + Crab cards, then multiply with Seagull (×2)

**Target Cards**:
- Fish: 10 cards, 1 point each → ×2 = 2 points
- Crab: 10 cards, 2 points each → ×2 = 4 points
- Seagull: 4 cards, 5 points each

**Optimal Execution**:
1. **Collect Fish/Crab early** (20 cards total = high availability)
2. **Draw Seagulls** (4 cards = 5.6% of deck)
3. **Pair Fish/Crab** for their effects (draw cards)
4. **Calculate multiplied score** at ~15+ Fish/Crab

**Example Winning Hand**:
```
With 2 Seagulls:
- 6 Fish = 6×2 = 12 points (multiplied)
- 6 Crab = 12×2 = 24 points (multiplied)
- 2 Seagull = 10 points (base)
- 2 other = ~4 points
Total: 50 points ✓
```

**Math**:
```
Each Fish with Seagull = 2 points (vs 1 base)
Each Crab with Seagull = 4 points (vs 2 base)
Seagull itself = 5 points

Break-even: Need ~10 Fish/Crab to justify 1 Seagull
Optimal: 12-15 Fish/Crab + 2-3 Seagulls
```

**Pros**:
- Very high point ceiling (can exceed 60 points)
- Fish/Crab are common (20 cards)
- Pair effects help draw more cards

**Cons**:
- Requires drawing Seagulls (only 4 in deck)
- Competes with Color Focus (both want Fish/Crab)
- Seagulls are expensive (5 points each)

**Counter-Play**:
- Steal Seagulls (4-value cards, can be stolen)
- Force early Stop declaration
- Compete for Fish/Crab from discard piles

---

### Strategy 3: Pair Effect Chain (TACTICAL)

**Concept**: Use pair effects to gain card advantage, then out-value opponents

**Key Pairs**:
1. **Sailboat × Sailboat** = Extra turn (once per round)
   - Use extra turn to pair more cards
   - Massive tempo advantage

2. **Crab × Crab** = Draw from discard (choose best card)
   - Cherry-pick high-value cards
   - Deny opponents' targets

3. **Fish × Fish** = Draw from deck (blind)
   - Consistent card advantage
   - Low risk

4. **Shark × Swimmer** = Steal card (≤3 value)
   - Disrupts opponent
   - Gains you a card

**Optimal Execution**:
1. **Early game**: Pair Fish/Crab for card draw
2. **Mid game**: Pair Sailboat for extra turn if available
3. **Late game**: Use Shark/Swimmer to steal key cards
4. **Always**: Maximize cards in hand before declaring

**Example Turn Sequence**:
```
Turn 5:
1. Pair Sailboat → Extra turn triggered
2. Extra turn: Pair Crab → Draw Seagull from discard
3. Pair Fish → Draw another card
4. End turn with 3 more cards than normal
```

**Pros**:
- Flexible (adapts to draws)
- High card advantage
- Can combine with other strategies

**Cons**:
- Requires specific pairs
- Sailboat limited to once per round
- Steal effect restricted (≤3 value)

**Counter-Play**:
- Hoard high-value cards (can't be stolen)
- Keep discard piles clean (no good targets)
- Declare Stop early to limit their turns

---

### Strategy 4: Shell/Octopus Combo

**Concept**: Collect Shells, multiply with Octopus (×2)

**Target Cards**:
- Shell: 8 cards, 1 point each → ×2 = 2 points
- Octopus: 4 cards, 4 points each

**Optimal Execution**:
1. Collect Shells early (1 point cards, low priority for others)
2. Draw Octopus (4 cards in deck)
3. Calculate: 8 Shells ×2 = 16 points + Octopus 4 = 20 points
4. Combine with other cards to reach 50

**Example Winning Hand**:
```
With 2 Octopus:
- 7 Shell = 7×2 = 14 points (multiplied)
- 2 Octopus = 8 points (base)
- 8 Starfish = 16 points
- 3 Fish = 3 points
- Color bonus = 3 points
Total: 44 points (need +6 more)
```

**Pros**:
- Shells are low-competition (others ignore them)
- All purple cards (contributes to color bonus)
- Octopus base value increased to 4

**Cons**:
- Only 8 Shells available (limited ceiling)
- Requires multiple Octopus to be effective
- Lower point ceiling than Seagull strategy

**Counter-Play**:
- Steal Octopus cards (4-value, can be stolen)
- Compete for Shells if you see them collecting
- Declare Stop early

---

### Strategy 5: High-Value Collection

**Concept**: Focus on collecting high-point cards (4-5 value)

**Target Cards**:
- Sailboat: 6 cards, 5 points each = 30 max
- Seagull: 4 cards, 5 points each = 20 max
- Shark: 6 cards, 4 points each = 24 max
- Swimmer: 6 cards, 4 points each = 24 max
- Octopus: 4 cards, 4 points each = 16 max
- Penguin: 4 cards, 4 points each = 16 max

**Optimal Execution**:
1. **Draw from discard** when high-value cards appear
2. **Use Crab pairs** to cherry-pick from discard
3. **Avoid low-value cards** (Fish, Shell, Starfish)
4. **Target**: 10-12 high-value cards = 45-50 points

**Example Winning Hand**:
```
- 3 Sailboat = 15 points
- 2 Seagull = 10 points
- 2 Shark = 8 points
- 2 Swimmer = 8 points
- 1 Penguin = 4 points
- 2 Starfish = 4 points
Total: 49 points (declare Stop at 12 threshold)
```

**Pros**:
- Straightforward (just collect value)
- No dependency on specific cards
- Can declare Stop relatively early

**Cons**:
- High competition for these cards
- Fewer total cards available (24 cards of 4-5 value)
- No multiplier effects

**Counter-Play**:
- Compete for high-value cards
- Steal their best cards (if ≤3 value)
- Force early declaration

---

### Strategy 6: Balanced Mixed

**Concept**: Adapt to what you draw, no specific focus

**Approach**:
- Take best available card each turn
- Pair when opportune
- Declare when reach 12+ points comfortably

**Pros**:
- Low risk
- Always viable
- No specific counter

**Cons**:
- Lower win rate (~15-20%)
- No standout strength
- Can be out-specialized

**When to Use**:
- Weak opening hand
- Unclear strategy from draws
- Learning the game

---

### Strategy 7: Mermaid Rush (HIGH RISK)

**Concept**: Attempt to collect 5 mermaids for instant win

**Requirements**:
- 6 Mermaids in deck
- Need 5 to win
- Opening hand: 7 cards

**Probability Analysis**:
```
P(2+ Mermaids in opening) = 12.6%
P(3+ Mermaids in opening) = 1.6%

If you have 2 Mermaids:
- Need 3 more from remaining 65 cards
- With card draw effects: ~4-6 more turns
- Success rate: ~8-12%
```

**Execution**:
1. **Only pursue if** you have 2+ Mermaids in opening hand
2. **Use all draw effects** (Crab, Fish, Sailboat)
3. **Steal Mermaids** with Shark/Swimmer if you see them
4. **Ignore point optimization** (Mermaids are 0 value)

**Pros**:
- Instant win (bypasses 50 point target)
- Unexpected (opponents may not see it coming)
- Fun high-risk play

**Cons**:
- Very low success rate (~8-12%)
- Leaves you with low points if you fail
- Vulnerable to opponents stealing your Mermaids
- 5-card requirement is difficult

**Counter-Play**:
- If you see opponent collecting Mermaids, steal them
- Declare Stop to end the round
- Compete for draw effects

---

## Counter-Strategies

### Against Color Focus
**Identify**: Opponent hoarding one color

**Counter**:
1. **Steal their color cards** (Shark/Swimmer)
2. **Take from discard** before they can (Crab)
3. **Declare Stop early** before they collect enough
4. **Diversify your colors** to compete for color bonus

---

### Against Seagull Multiplier
**Identify**: Opponent collecting Fish/Crab + Seagulls

**Counter**:
1. **Steal Seagulls** (4-value, within steal range in v2.0)
2. **Compete for Fish/Crab** from discard piles
3. **Declare Stop** around 15 turns (before they collect enough)
4. **Note**: Seagull itself is 5 points (too high to steal)

---

### Against Pair Effect Chain
**Identify**: Opponent pairing frequently, drawing extra cards

**Counter**:
1. **Keep discard piles clean** (don't discard valuable cards)
2. **Declare Stop** to limit their turns
3. **Steal their paired cards** to break synergy
4. **Hoard high-value cards** they can't steal (≥4 points)

---

### Against Mermaid Rush
**Identify**: Opponent has 0-value cards, using draw effects

**Counter**:
1. **Steal Mermaids immediately** when you see them
2. **Declare Stop early** (don't give them time)
3. **Force them to show cards** (Shark/Swimmer)
4. **Track Mermaid count** (6 in deck, if 3+ in discard, they can't win)

---

## Advanced Tactics

### 1. Discard Pile Management

**When Discarding to Left/Right**:
```
Good Discard Targets:
- Low-value cards opponents don't want (Fish, Shell)
- Cards that don't fit your strategy
- Duplicates of cards you already have pairs of

Bad Discard Targets:
- High-value cards (Sailboat, Seagull)
- Cards that complete opponent's strategy
- Rare cards (Octopus, Penguin)
```

**Reading Opponent Discards**:
- If they discard Fish/Crab → Likely pursuing high-value strategy
- If they discard Shells → Not doing Octopus combo
- If they discard Mermaids → Definitely not Mermaid rush

---

### 2. Draw Decision Matrix

**When to Draw from Deck** (2 cards, choose 1):
- Early game (turns 1-5)
- When discard piles are empty
- When you need specific cards (fishing for pairs)

**When to Draw from Discard** (1 card, guaranteed):
- When there's a high-value card (4-5 points)
- When there's a card that completes your pair
- When there's a card that fits your strategy (color, multiplier)

**When to Use Crab Pair**:
- When there's a perfect card in discard
- When opponent just discarded something valuable
- To deny opponent their target card

---

### 3. Timing Your Declaration

**When to Declare Stop** (score ×1.2, no extra turns):
- You have 15+ point lead over second place
- You have 45+ points with good multipliers
- You suspect opponent is close to 50 points
- Late game (turn 15+)

**When to Declare Last Chance** (normal score, everyone gets turn):
- You have marginal lead (5-10 points)
- You want to see if opponents can catch up
- You're at exactly 50 points (safe)
- You have good hand but not overwhelming lead

**When NOT to Declare**:
- You're below 12 points (minimum threshold)
- Opponent has more cards than you (advantage)
- You have Sailboat pair ready (extra turn better)
- You have strong draw potential (can gain more)

---

### 4. Penguin Scoring Optimization

**Penguin Effect**: Each pair you played counts as 2 points

**Example**:
```
If you have 2 Penguins and played 4 pairs:
- 4 pairs × 2 points = 8 bonus points
- 2 Penguins = 8 base points
- Total from Penguins: 16 points

Breakeven: Need 2+ pairs to justify 1 Penguin
Optimal: 4-5 pairs + 2 Penguins = ~20 bonus points
```

**Strategy**:
- Pair aggressively early game
- Draw Penguins mid-late game
- Calculate bonus before declaring

---

### 5. Mermaid Scoring Mechanics

**Mermaid Special Scoring** (if not going for 5-card win):
- 1st Mermaid = Points equal to your most common color count
- 2nd Mermaid = Points equal to your 2nd most common color count
- 3rd Mermaid = Points equal to your 3rd most common color count

**Example**:
```
Your Hand:
- 8 Blue cards (most common)
- 5 Red cards (2nd most)
- 3 Yellow cards (3rd most)
- 2 Mermaids

Mermaid Scoring:
- 1st Mermaid = 8 points
- 2nd Mermaid = 5 points
- Total: 13 points from Mermaids!
```

**Optimization**:
- If you have 2-3 Mermaids (not going for 5), focus on color diversity
- Maximize your top 3 color counts
- Can be 10-15 bonus points

---

## Timing Guide

### Early Game (Turns 1-5)

**Goals**:
- Identify your strategy based on opening hand
- Pair low-value cards for draw effects (Fish, Crab)
- Build card advantage

**Avoid**:
- Declaring Stop (too early)
- Discarding high-value cards
- Committing to strategy too early

**Key Decisions**:
- Which color to focus on
- Whether to pair now or save for later
- Draw from deck vs discard

---

### Mid Game (Turns 6-12)

**Goals**:
- Execute your chosen strategy
- Reach 30-40 points
- Position for endgame

**Avoid**:
- Letting opponent get too far ahead
- Ignoring opponent strategies
- Wasting pair effects

**Key Decisions**:
- When to use Sailboat extra turn
- When to steal opponent's cards
- Whether to declare Stop early

---

### Late Game (Turns 13+)

**Goals**:
- Reach 50 points
- Declare Stop or Last Chance
- Win the game

**Avoid**:
- Waiting too long (opponent declares first)
- Declaring too early (opponents catch up)
- Forgetting color bonus

**Key Decisions**:
- Stop vs Last Chance
- Final discard choice (denying opponent)
- Whether to steal or draw

---
